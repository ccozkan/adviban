--Advanced Vibration Analysis Toolbox for Octave and probably for matlab.--
###information
  
  *I'm creating this toolbox for my Advanced Vibration Analysis Class and it will contain usefull functions and scripts for that are covered in class.
  
  *So I'll update this repo thorugh the class (Spr. 2016, and after hopefully will work on this as a side project.

  *Using toolbox for matlab might need a bit tweaking since Octave supports more syntax flexibility than matlab, and I wont test the scripts and functions on matlab when they are good-to-go for Octave.
